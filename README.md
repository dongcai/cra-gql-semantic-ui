## About
This project is intended to provide some (hopefully many eventually) HOWTO examples of using React / GraphQL (Apollo) / Semantic-UI. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## GraphQL Server
Originally, the project used Apollo Launchpad to serve the GraphQL server. Since they discontinued the service on 12/15/2018. The code is moved to the local, whici is 'server' folder in the project directory. 

## Run 

To start the server, `cd` to the 'server' folder, and you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Then to start the client, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`
